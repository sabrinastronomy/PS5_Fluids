Solution to integrating numerical 1D fluids equations as described in Problem Set 5 of the Astrophysical Fluids class taught by Prof. Eve Lee.

Running `python ps_5_3.py` will show a real time solution to the the advection equation using the FTCS and Lax-Friedrich methods.

Running `python ps_5_4.py` will show a real time solution to the the advection-diffusion equation using the Lax-Friedrich methods.

Running `python ps_5_5.py` will show a 1D hydro solver simulation using the donor cell advection scheme.
